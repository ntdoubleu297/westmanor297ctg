    "description": "DO NOT MISS THE GREAT MINI-MOVIE UNDER THE VIRTUAL TOUR.  IT'S MUST SEE T.V.!  Turnkey, mint condition.  Great jazz is floating through the air, someone's cranking up the cocktail shaker, and EVERYONE'S having a great time.  This is the little house that ROARED. EZ flow from Liv. Rm. to Din. Rm. to intimate den, all paved in beautiful, new hardwood floors.  Speaking of new:  Here's the list: Brand new magazine-worthy kitchen w/ all new appliances, brand new roof, new a/c, updated plumbing, high impact windows, new hot water heater, brand new paint inside and out, new, upgraded insulation, updated plumbing.  There's a genuine intimacy here that easily converts to ballgame parties, dinner parties, kids' birthday celebrations, or just dinner for two.  The large screened lanai enjoys views of the generous yard high-lighted by a big shady oak, planted the year the present owners first moved in. And, for extra storage and projects, the large (13 x 10) shed is wired with electricity. The half bath/utility room is not reflected in the county records, so add an extra 48 sq.ft.  A friendly, no-thru circle, this is one of the prettiest streets in Margaret Anne Subdivision.... with ez access to Westshore on one end and Manhattan on the other, close to  an electorama of activities:  Walk to Dairy Joy, the vegetable market, shabby chic shops, or hop the Gandy to the beaches.  Welcome Home!",

    "description": "3/2/1 block home in Bayside, South Tampa. CLEAN SOLID HOME AS IS. Could be liveable as a residence or rental with minor improvements. Could be flipped and brought to a higher retail value (250-450k depending on finishes) with upgrades and cosmetic work. Original terrazzo flooring, newer Trane AC unit and handler, newer hot water heater and windows, needs a new roof, spacious backyard with concrete patio. There is also a separate utility/storage room off the garage. GREAT investment opportunity.",

This home sits just in between Manhattan and West Shore on a quiet street with no thru traffic and is minutes to great restaurants and shopping. The front of the home opens to the spacious living area with big windows that bring in quite a bit of natural light. The kitchen features granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, and a raised bar stool height breakfast counter. Just off of the living area is a large hallway connecting the bathroom and both bedrooms. On the opposite end of the home is a sunken space that can be used as a dining room, or the living area depending on how you work it! The sliding barn doors add function and decoration by concealing the stacked washer and dryer and also a small utility room that leads to the backyard. The backyard has it all and offers a large over-hang to hide from the sun, concrete parking pad, and lush green grass! It's the perfect space for entertaining on beautiful Florida days. AC and Roof are both less than 6 years old.",

    "description": "Large and spacious 4 bed/2 bath home in Lawai Valley. Most of the front half of the house has been renovated in the past few years. Highlights include the open floor plan with the bright and airy living room opening up to the dining space and kitchen. The kitchen features plenty of storage and a large pass-through to the living room. There's a flex space off the dining area which could be used as a family room. Another room in this space needs some work but could serve as a large storage area, home office, gym or craft room. The main bedroom has its own en suite which has been updated with beautiful tile-accented floors and shower. Two other bedrooms and the renovated hall bathroom round out this space.  The back half of the house is where your imagination comes into play. There's a large living area with a wet bar and sliding doors out to the back yard. It also has its own entrance. There are two other rooms down the hallway, one of which has double closets. A third bathroom is also located in this portion of the house.  Additional renovation highlights include:  * Roof replaced in 2016 with flat roof replaced in 2020 * Gutters installed in 2022 * New exterior paint in 2022   Live in the front portion of the home while you do some improvements and enhancements to the back half of the house. This could be your dream home for those that want to put a little sweat equity into their house.",

Built-in shelving in key locations will be appreciated. More storage in the attic with pull-down ladder.  Speaking of studs, owner went so far as to replace the 2x3 framing with 2x4s, then insulated the walls, then fresh sheetrock back on. Newer Travertine tile flooring throughout. Owner installed tongue and groove 3/4\" wood planks in the vaulted ceiling, then finished everything off with recessed lighting, accent lighting, and down lighting. Newer window frames. Two private exterior Ipe-decked lanais with outdoor showers. Even the lava-rock wall was dismantled and rebuilt with hollow-tile block wall core and lava-rock exterior.   Lush Lawai location makes it easy to jump on the highway and head to town, beach, or wonderful Westside. Conveniently commutable to Lihue and PMRF.",

The large, open concept living area is situated perfectly to take in those views and breezes. You'll have plenty of room to entertain in the combined living/dining/kitchen area which leads you out onto the expansive lanai. The kitchen is sure to please with its solid wood cabinets, granite counters and stainless steel appliances. You'll also find two guest bedrooms and the full guest bath on this floor. The entire top floor is your own private retreat - large master bedroom with its own fully covered lanai, walk-in closet and master bath. Again, the views are stunning. If you're able to take yourself away from the views at the front of the home, you'll enjoy spending time in your fully fenced in back yard where you can spend hours gardening and tinkering. There's plenty of storage for your vehicles or toys in the oversized 3-car garage with additional space for parking in the large driveway. All of this and you're just a short walk from Kukuilono Park and all of the amenities that Kalaheo offers.

    "description": "A drive to the top of Puulima Road is to discover a bit of unexpected seclusion.  Walking in the front door of this home greets me with a sense of peace. I found myself immediately inspired by the finishes, hardwoods, high ceilings, soft color palette... the essentials of a home that is a modern-day version of a Hawaiian plantation home, with all of the care associated with that.  I was escorted about by the homeowners who showed me the enchanting things that make this home so special to them. I asked them what they loved about it and one of my favorite responses was showering under the stars in the outdoor shower with the fragrant lavender orchids that are attached to the lava rock wall. The chef’s kitchen is perfect for making elaborate meals while gazing at the ocean, and the island range allows the chef to remain engaged with guests. The oversized office can be shuttered from the rest of the home for privacy and distance work.  My favorite part of the home is the screened-in lanai with its valley and ocean views and cool breezes. I thought that I could live in that one space but there is so much more to enjoy.",

    "description": "Two plantation era dwellings in a very private setting are located on half an acre in Kalaheo Homesteads and allow for the flexibility of extended family, guests, home office or potential income. Enjoy expansive views toward Mount Kahili.  The 3-bedroom one bath home has hardwood flooring throughout the living area and bedrooms. East facing living room picture window frames the view across vacant land and surrounding valleys. Louvered windows from the bedroom/bath wing to the south look out to the private level backyard with terraced area and fruit trees down below. 4 steps down from the kitchen you'll find what was once a 2-car garage that is currently an enclosed unpermitted Rec Room/storage area with laundry room, laundry tub, stacked washer/dryer and toilet room on the back side. The natural slope of the property and post and pier construction lends itself to a large storage space under part of the home, perfect for yard tools, mango pickers and hanging endless bunches of bananas.   A 1 bath Studio was moved to the parcel in 2010 creating a fully permitted ADU by 2013. It was secured on a concrete block foundation; and a front porch was added. The sloping terrain of the side and back yard allow for storage space under the dwelling.  The terraced backyard provides seasonal grapefruit, mango, tangerine, tangelo, orange, lemon, not to mention Apple and Williams’ bananas, mac nuts, strawberry guava, guava, rambutan, 4 mature avocado trees blooming and fruiting at various times throughout the year and beautiful tropical flowers and vegetation.   Carport, lean-to and attached storage shed provides parking for 2 vehicles, various outdoor toys and storage. Spacious cement driveway has ample parking for both dwellings as well as guests. Kalaheo town and amenities is just 2 miles down the road with Poipu Beach and incredible sunsets 20 minutes away.",

    "description": "Beautiful custom home on a private acre of tropical paradise. This is the heart of Hawai’i Mauka Country Living sequestered on a full acre in the cool mountainside of Lawai. Five bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths make this a wonderful family home or a fabulous personal sanctuary where you can work in privacy or retire in comfort, with plenty of room for guests! Extra rooms could provide a private office, a sunlight yoga room with gentle breezes, or an inspired art studio. Its potential to customize is limitless. The open kitchen, hardwood floors, and wood-burning fireplace in the great room make it a welcoming home for family celebrations, entertaining, or simply relaxing. Lanais overlook an albizia forest, the verdant Lawai Valley and Kalaheo pastures, your own tropical gardens, fruit trees adorned with orchids, and expansive garden that provides farm fresh produce and herbs. Two master bedrooms face east to receive gentle Kaua’i sunrises filtered through the privacy of tropical gardens. The upstairs master bedroom has an indoor jacuzzi  tub and walk-in closet. Spectacular sunsets grace the kitchen window, the great room, the two upstairs bedrooms and back lanais. Monarch butterflies, green parrots, and cardinals enjoy the farmland and garden. Starlit nights bring sweet peace and quiet to every room in the house. The two-car garage and extra storage rooms under the house provide many spatial options. You must see this house if you are looking for privacy, quiet, and to surround yourself with the beauty of the Garden Isle!!!! Brand new septic system was put in August 2021 at the same time as an additional basement level suite with an entrance from inside the house and another outside the house.",

    "description": "A fabulous opportunity to own two homes on a nice size lot on one of the quietest streets in Kalaheo.  The front home is a charming two-bedroom, one and a half bath cottage of more than 1200 square feet.  It has beautiful hardwood floors and a loft area for fun or storage.  The lanai is large enough to host dinner parties and when it is a little cool outside (those wonderful evenings in Kalaheo) there is a great dining space inside.  The kitchen has enough counter space for any chef along with cabinet space for all that you might have. The back ADU that has a grass-block driveway for access to your two-car garage that is currently being used for a workout space, surfboard storage, office..a perfect \"Man Cave\". The metallic epoxy coating on the garage floor will catch your attention as soon as you walk in.  You will see from the photos that the ADU has high quality finishes and stainless steel appliances, there is even a cast iron tub on the lanai for those special evenings. The established bamboo fence (just lovely) adds privacy to the side yard which is only enhanced by the tranquil large water pot next to it. A highlight of the property are the Solar PV Panels which includes 19 panels (you will also note the Tesla Battery) which keeps the KIUC bill well below $100.00 per month and at times as low as $6.00 for both homes (the utilities are shared between both houses). This is property will not disappoint. The properties are tenant occupied and requires a 48-hour notice to show.",

    "description": "This turn key home is located on a large lot, on the mountain side of Kalaheo, this immaculate house has peek-a-boo views of the ocean and spectacular views of the evening sunset. When you drive down the long private road near the end, you are greeted by a traditional plantation style home surrounded by the love and pride the current owners have put into the landscaping.   A large selection of fruit trees, vegetables and flowers flourish on the property. With a nine plot fully fenced garden that provides fresh organic vegetables, and a newly built 10 x 14 shed with a workbench and lots of shelving.   Behind the shed, attached to the carport, is a covered area for storing supplies. Located beneath the house in the 2 vehicle carport lies lots of space for your kayaks, canoes, and bikes to be locked away out of sight.   Inside, you are greeted by high pine ceilings with soft Douglas fir floors in the living room.  A recently remodeled kitchen awaits with new natural slate tile and local curly mango trim. New waterproof laminate koa wood flooring completes the updated look. Enjoy the view of the hillside above the house which often has friendly horses frolicking in the field. There is ample cabinet space as well as two pantry style cabinets, new double door refrigerator with a water filter and ice maker.  This two bedroom, one and 1/4 bath home has a pleasantly surprising amount of room in both bedrooms. The master bedroom fits a king size bed while the guest room fits a queen.

    "description": "Enjoy big ocean views and bright, airy living spaces in this beautifully renovated home in Kalaheo.    Intelligent architecture, updated finishes, extensive window lining, great airflow, and generous outdoor living areas are the characteristics that define this elegant hillside residence.  The elevated main living area offers an open floor plan with that “great room” feel, as the kitchen, dining, family room, and loft areas are all adjoined and share the ample light and space created by the vaulted tongue and groove ceiling above.  Ocean views are enjoyed from all parts of the great room, but none more than from the oversized exterior lanai, allowing this property to offer the best of both indoor and outdoor living.  Adjacent to the great room and on the same level are two (2) ensuite bedrooms, as well as a picturesque garden view lanai.  On the lower level, separately accessible from the carport, is a laundry area with a sink, as well as the third (3rd) bedroom (not pictured) with a neighboring bathroom – an arrangement offering great separation and privacy for the downstairs occupant.  Relatively recent renovations to this very well-maintained home include new engineered hardwood floors throughout, refurbished kitchen and bathrooms, installation of a split-unit air-conditioning system, new roof, and new paint.  Truly a great opportunity for those seeking a move-in ready home with charm and great ocean views on the south shore.  **  3rd bedroom on lower level not photographed. **",

    "description": "BACK ON THE MARKET! Tucked away on a private road on Kauai's south side is a hidden gem of a home on 2.6 acres of land. Designed by noted Big Island architect, the late Boone Morrison, and constructed by Kauai-builder Bob Mikkelsen, the home combines an overall feeling of Hawaiiana with the clean lines of mid-century modern design—truly a one-of-a-kind. Boone employed a practice of designing large, usable rooms, lighted by massive windows on several sides, with soaring ceilings and gleaming hardwood floors. This over 3,000 sf home is a wonderful example of his work.   Slate floors greet you at the entrance of the home and into the kitchen and baths. Custom woodwork, including the remaining flooring, lanai, custom trim work and beams, is featured throughout the home, all from locally-sourced hardwoods. The home was constructed in two phases, with the entry, kitchen, large dining room, primary suite and additional bath on one side, and the grand living room and loft/office on the other. The two structures are connected via a 1000 sf covered lanai, adding an abundance of usable outdoor living space to the overall footprint of the home. The total combined square footage under roof is 4355. Guest house rights are included with the property.  The current owners have transformed the land into a botanical garden with one of the most extensive collections of rare palms and cycads in the Hawaiian Islands. The property features an extensive network of paved pathways interconnected with trails which lead to a stream and waterfall below the property, and panoramic views of the surrounding areas from the ridge line above the home. * The adjacent 1.68 acre parcel with two-car garage, workshop and house rights can also be purchased with this property.

Enjoy cool breezes and pastoral views from your 288 sf covered lanai and 244 additional sf of wraparound deck overlooking the lush back yard. Another 1,440 sf of storage/workshop is under the home! The roof was recently updated to metal, the exterior has been freshly painted, and the flooring has been upgraded to \"Kauai-proof\" Luxury Vinyl Plank. Enjoy bananas, citrus, avocado, guava, ginger, two aquaponics beds, and plenty of room to add more. This is an ag lot and some farm animals are allowed!   The main floor of the home is an open concept kitchen, dining, and living area which flows out onto the covered lanai. This living area has high beamed ceilings and many windows. Down the hall is a laundry closet, a full bathroom, linen closet and both the Primary bedroom with ensuite (and a separate entrance), and a second bedroom. Upstairs is a 704 sf loft with AC. Currently the loft is sectioned off into an office/family room, and a guest bedroom but could be used in many different ways. The loft has generous storage cupboards.  This property is conveniently located in Kalaheo with shopping, schools, post office, and churches all very close. It is centrally located: just 15 minutes from the island business district of Lihue (Costco, airport, Target), the restaurants and beaches of Poipu, and the fun and laid back Hanapepe town.",

    "description": "Welcome to your future home! This incredible property is conveniently located just a half mile from the scenic Cliff Walk, is LESS THAN ONE MILE from First Beach and exactly one mile from THAMES STREET! This home is a short walk to some of Newport’s most desirable locations and is any buyer’s dream. In this safe and quiet neighborhood, you’re close enough to the fun but far enough away from a slice of peace and tranquility. Truly the best of both worlds! This 3 unit, 7 bedroom, 3.5 bath property sits on a lot size that is double to most of the surrounding lots. It offers premium off-street parking with 6-8 spots, only for residents. PROPERTY IS BEING SOLD AS IS but has incredible potential. The first and second floors need updating and are completely vacant. The third floor was renovated within the last five years and is currently rented. Who doesn’t want to buy a multi-family in Newport? Between the desirable location, the upgrade potential and beautiful neighborhood, this property could be worth millions. If you’re looking for a diamond in the rough, then look no further.",

There is plenty of parking on the premises as well as adequate off-street parking out front.  Two of the residential units are currently rented - the owners have held off renting the third leaving it for the new owner to decide. Hardwood floors are throughout the building keeping up with the charm of the 1870 built home. Future plans could include an expansion over the garage bays or conversion back to a single-family home. The possibilities for the property are truly endless all while continuing to have great income generating investment potential.",

Each unit has a private entrance. The main house offers generous living space with formal living room, kitchen, dining room, full bathroom, and den on the first floor. The second floor has an oversized master bedroom with a sweet Juliet balcony, two additional bedrooms, and full bathroom with laundry.  Large attic space also offers expansive opportunities.  The garden apartment has an additional two bedrooms, full bathroom, kitchen and living room.  A private pavered yard blooms with mature foliage and has a pergola for added privacy and comfort. Centrally located in the Historic Point, you can enjoy baseball games at Cardines field, walk to the Newport Shipyard and waterfront, enjoy downtown Thames St dining and shopping, and easily access the Pell Bridge for getting on and off Aquidneck Island. Experience all that Newport has to offer at this central location.",

    "description": "Investors take note… Legal 4 unit property located in the Fifth Ward.  This property has two separate buildings on one lot.   The building closest to the street is the rental property.  The second building lends itself to being a great owner-occupied property….Live for free, or rent it out for positive cash flow.   The front building is the original 1920’s home that has been converted into three units, 2 - 1 BD/1 BA and 1 -2BD/1 BA.  The property has an excellent rental history…all three units currently have leases in place (the sale is contingent on all leases being honored).  In the back is the detached garage that has been converted into a very spacious 4BD owner’s unit boasting two full baths with custom marble showers and a great open living room.      The property has been well maintained through the years.  The newer roof has 30-year architectural shingles.  The vinyl siding is great for easy exterior maintenance.  The new PVC fence surrounding the entire property gives you privacy all year round.  Tons of off-street parking, which is always in demand in Newport.  Partial water views, the home sits directly across the street from Spencer Park, and adjacent to the property is Kings Park which is right on the water.  Don’t forget the proximity to downtown Newport, local beaches, and the many parks and recreational opportunities in the area.  Seller wants to sell the entire property turnkey.",

    "description": "Looking for an opportunity to own property in the Point?  Look no further than here. This two-family home has a two-bedroom first floor unit with an eat-in kitchen, small living room and comfortably sized full bath. The second story unit consists of two floors, with the lower level offering an eat-in kitchen, living room, bedroom and full bath. The upper level features two bedrooms and a half bath. Two Velux skylights bring lots of natural light to the second level landing and bath.   Surrounded by stunning homes, this forgotten gem could easily be returned to a single-family home, or renovated and kept as a two-family home bringing in high end summer rentals and winter rentals. Located a couple of blocks from the harbor, Washington Square and other Newport attractions, the potential for this property is worth taking a look at. Live in it while renovating, rent one unit while working on the other. The house has consistently brought in annual and summer/winter rentals for many years (first floor unit has been an annual rental, second floor unit's rent reflects summer and winter rates combined.  Both apartments have been rented under market rates). Investors take note!!",

Only the first and second floor are living space now but there is expansion space in the lower level and the attic. With approval perhaps a dormer could be added that would afford harbor views. Behind the brown roofing shingles that covers the exterior is clapboard siding that could possibly be restored. The one car garage, though in disrepair, is such a great asset in the downtown area of Newport. Beautiful wide planks line the attic floor and the two fireplaces in the basement show the original beauty of this home. The back yard would make a wonderful intown oasis. The house is in need of a full restoration but its location, size and parking makes this a great value and an opportunity to create your dream home.    Any offer will require probate approval. Details on how this process works can be supplied if requested.",

    "description": "Rare 4-5 unit multi-family in the heart of Newport's famed Yachting Village! With rental rates currently FAR under market value, there is plenty of 'meat on the bone' here for any savvy investor. Zoned for 5 separate units, but currently rented as 4, the necessaries have all been tended to: roof, boiler, hot water heaters and more. The first floor comprises the largest unit, a three bed (plus office) apartment with 2 full baths and direct access to the back yard. The second floor is divided into two lucrative apartments: a one bed one bath, and a two bed one bath. The top floor houses the marquis unit, which boasts an open floor-plan and a roof-deck with sweeping views of Newport Harbor! Truly a diamond in the rough for anyone looking to maximize income potential.",

Each two level, 1080 sq. ft. unit has two beds, one bath and a large basement (for storage or potential additional living space).

Enjoy idyllic days and evenings from your front porch or either of the two decks. Dual driveways offer ample parking. Located in Newport's desirable Fifth Ward, just a short distance to King's Park and downtown Newport. Only minutes to parks, beaches, mansions and all that this lovely city has to offer. Immersive 3D tour available upon request. Tenants in place until May 31 and August 31 respectively.",

    "description": "Large two-family home in the Fifth Ward.  Located centrally, this property would be perfect for both investors and owner-occupied buyers. The first floor features two large bedrooms, living room and dining room along with a large kitchen and plenty of cabinetry. There is also a small extra room off one of the bedrooms that could serve as an office or walk-in closet. The full bath is located adjacent to the kitchen.   The second floor unit follows the same floor plan as the first floor unit, however, its bathroom is located where the extra room is in the first unit, with access to the bedroom and the hallway leading to its kitchen. The kitchen in this unit is larger and includes a window looking over the large back yard. This unit also features the original staircase from when the home was still a single family home. Its landing offers more living/storage space with a coat closet and room for furnishings. The unit has a set of stairs to the third floor where there are two small bedrooms, a large full bath and a wet bar. The third floor has central air conditioning.  Owner is incapacitated, so some information on the property is not readily available.  These apartments are under priced and could be rented for current rental rates.",

    "description": "This large two-family home located within a quiet neighborhood just off Broadway has spacious units that provide an ideal layout for an owner-occupied, income-producing property.  Or, it will perform well for an investor looking for a profitable multi-family with low maintenance yearly leases.  Both units have private entrances, separate utilities, original hardwood floors, tall ceilings, and updated kitchens fully equipped with modern appliances.  The first-floor unit has 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, a spacious living room, and a nice kitchen that opens to the dining room and foyer. The second-floor unit provides an open floor plan, 3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, and a private deck.  Unit 2 also has a great opportunity to substantially increase its size and rental income by converting the spacious third-floor walk-up into living space.  With the third floor's high ceilings, you could add at least 500 sq ft of legal living space without a dormer or add a large shed dormer and create a stunning \"owners unit.\" The third floor has already been plumbed for a full bath and wired with electricity. It is just waiting to be finished!  Other property features include a shared backyard,  just installed new oil boiler and hot water tank for unit 1, a new high-efficiency gas heating system for unit 2, separate electrical, and two water meters.  The large dry basement offers tenants more than enough room for storage, or, for the owner-occupied buyer, an ideal workshop or home gym.",

    "description": "\"The Telephone Building\" is an historic building in downtown Newport constructed in the late 19th century in Beaux-Arts style. This iconic, one-of-a-kind property was designed by Boston architects Perkins & Betton, the team behind the famed King Block on Newport's storied Bellevue Avenue. The building's brick and limestone façade features dentil molding and a grand Palladian window. The property was sensitively restored and converted into a residential building consisting of a spectacular loft-style owner's unit and various income opportunities, thanks to its location in the General Business zone. The owner's unit is contemporary in feel, yet retains historic elements, abounding in repurposed materials, exposed brick, oversized windows, and artisanal encaustic cement tile inserts. A floating staircase leads from the loft to an intimate rooftop salon that opens to a dramatic deck and green-roof garden overlooking Trinity Church, downtown Newport, and the Newport Bridge and Harbor. This unit lends itself to a live/work lifestyle with a first floor space that is ideal for an at-home office or gym. Just above the three-bedroom, 2.5 bathroom owner's space is a separate and stylish one-bedroom space with roof deck access--perfect for extended family or Airbnb income. Finally, there is a two-bedroom first floor apartment with a cool mix of hardwood and polished concrete floors and its own Zen garden nestled in the back of the property, creating an urban oasis.",

    "description": "Stately two-family home on one of Newport's iconic roadways!  446 Broadway is a very well maintained home with a two-car garage and a private, fenced yard.  The first floor apartment is currently arranged as a one-bedroom unit but could be two.  The second/third floor apartment is a 3-bedroom, 2-1/2 bath unit with a pellet stove.  The house was completely rehabbed in 2007.  That project included all walls and ceilings, electric, plumbing, granite countertops, new cabinets, and more.  The house was converted (legally) to a two family in 2010.  The conversion was completed carefully to allow a possible return to a single family layout.  Other extras include a newer high-efficiency gas boiler, high-efficiency water heater, and solar panels with reimbursement from National Grid.",

    "description": "These are two fully restored homes (circa 1860 & 1880) located in the Point section of Newport.  Both homes have been beautifully restored. They are within close walking distance to town and Newport harbor. There are four bedrooms, two full baths, two half baths, hardwood floors throughout, kitchen with granite counter tops and built in appliances. A french door to the rear of the property looks onto lovely mature gardens and trees. Property has been approved by the city to add off street parking.  If desired as an investment property one or both houses can be rented. The estimated rental income for both would be $48,000 to $50,000 per year. Property is also great for a family retreat or as a single family. \n",

A new, private deck allows for designated outdoor space. Conversion to gas heating was recently completed as well. The back house shares a similar open floor plan. A bonus room in the first floor features double doors out to the private deck and backyard area. The second floor, here, also has two large bedrooms and a full bathroom.  The lot is conveniently located within the desirable Historic Point neighborhood. Walking distance to downtown Newport and the waterfront. Easy access on and off Aquidneck Island.

"description": "OPEN HOUSE SUNDAY MARCH 24TH 1:00-3:00. Enter this bright and spacious 55+ active adult community home and you see immediately why the Edinburgh model is the most sought after unit that rarely comes up for sale. Constructed late during Henley Way's development, it maintains the open spaces as it eliminates the unnecessary 3rd bedroom of previous models. The additional square footage adds ample space to other critical living areas highlighted by a large eat-in kitchen with much more cabinetry and plenty of glass to let all the sunlight in. A separate, and well proportioned, dining and living room area gives plenty of space to entertain and leads to a sunroom that brings the outdoors in with 3 large slider units covering most of the outside walls. A large master suite includes full bath and walk-in closet. 2nd floor is a private location for guests or an office featuring a large bedroom, also with full bath and walk-in closet. Laundry area is tucked away near the master bedroom for convenience. Kitchen, sunroom, and all bathrooms have ceramic tile flooring. 2 pets (dogs or cats) of gentle disposition are allowed. Experience this newer construction condominium and see how the layout is the best in the complex.  Call Rick McCullough for a private showing at (413)531-5557.",

    "description": "This is the home one dreams of but never expects to find in the real world. This perfect oceanfront setting is complemented by a residence of exquisite style. Never to be replicated under current building restrictions, the villa is carefully positioned into the site just above the water’s edge. It takes advantage of the grandfathered position of its predecessor and as such, rests comfortably on the site as if it was always meant to be. The result is a unique relationship between the interiors and the vistas of the rugged coastline, azure waters, and sunsets that is simply unequalled on this coast. Nearly 7,000 square feet of living area was painstakingly designed by the esteemed firm of Tichenor & Thorp in a coastal Italian style. It takes full advantage of the scintillating and experiential sensory opportunities of the setting including the ocean breezes, sounds of the crashing waves, and the golden light that bathes the house throughout the day. The interiors are refined and comfortable, with each room carefully layered by a studied eye with antique materials and exceptional craftsmanship. The result is both harmonious and elegant. The house features a flowing, open, and eminently livable floor plan where one gracious room leads, uninterrupted, to the next. French doors open from every major room to seaside terraces and mature European gardens all cascading toward the shore. Antique inlaid garden walls dating back over 100 years create outdoor rooms, overlooks, and guide a private path to the sand below. The primary suite is situated on the top floor and enjoys a majestic positioning. It includes a private view terrace, a Moroccan themed bath, and ample closet + dressing area. Another ocean view suite shares this floor. The main level includes the living room, which adjoins the paneled family room. The family room leads in one direction to the bar, guest bath, and main guest suite. In the other direction, it leads to the formal dining room, immense kitchen, and a sea view morning room. A large view terrace on this level is complemented by a fireplace and offers a wonderful setting for entertaining and dining. The lowest level functions as a complete ‘guest house’. Carefully positioned terraces and overlooks are sculpted into the bluff and adorned with colorful and flourishing gardens. The opportunities for living and entertaining here are beyond compare, yet it retains a luxurious ambiance and extraordinary privacy. In a word, this home is “perfection”.",

    "description": "Proof that you can have it all. Just above the waves and sandy beach, 1165 Gaviota sits in a perfect location with all the wonder of oceanfront living on one side of the property and the delights of storied Laguna Beach at your doorstep on the other. Newly constructed and stunningly rendered from the plans of renowned C. J. Light Associates and masterfully executed by Robinson Builders, Inc. - Bill Robinson, the residence will be delivered to the new owner furnished by acclaimed designer Michael Fullen. Sophisticated yet casual and welcoming, the vibe is California coastal with a little bit of Laguna twist. The main living level is accessed through a private courtyard beautifully hardscaped with Pennsylvania Bluestone, which features an outdoor kitchen and entertainment venue. The formal entry welcomes one into a great room concept kitchen and living area centered on the panoramic vista of the ocean, Catalina, and coastline views. Retractable Reveal doors form a wall of glass that opens to two generously sized decks above the crashing surf. No expense has been spared in this ultra-luxe appointed residence. The main house offers four (potentially five) bedrooms and four full bathrooms plus powder room as well as laundry with dual washers and dryers. The detached guest suite offers a bedroom, living space, kitchenette, and private laundry. The rooftop deck, extremely rare for an oceanfront Laguna home, offers a second outdoor dining option with dumbwaiter access to the main kitchen level. The entire property features SMART home technology utilizing top-of-the-line Crestron Home Automation System. It is powered by solar energy with battery backup. Configured to function as a primary residence, but with the convenience to 'button up' as a vacation home. Few are able to own on this rarefied oceanfront stretch of the California Riviera.",

    "description": "9 Lagunita is a manifestation of boundless creativity, and privacy, situated on the best beach in all of Laguna.... This property could never be recreated or built today, truly a one-of-a-kind Ocean Front within your own private gated street. Located on Victory beach this property is completely open on all four sides with privacy like no other oceanfront you have seen.... Not only is the property private but you have your own private entry gate to your street that only services your home and one other used as a 2nd vacation property.... You will be unable to find another oceanfront property in Laguna Beach that has more to offer, while also checking all the boxes.... Over 6500+ square feet of decadent interiors that host 6 bedrooms, 6.5 baths, a gym, office, and beach-ready area featuring an outdoor shower and dog wash, direct access to the sand, beach, and ocean.... Enjoys unparalleled views of breaking waves, Catalina Island, and sunsets.... The outdoor living space and a massive backyard with mature trees and landscaping throughout are not believable.... When you're walking this property, you will continue to ask yourself how this can exist here in Laguna... There is no other Ocean front in Orange Country that can compete with all this has to offer.... The photos are great, but this property is all about the feel and experience while being there... This is The Last One, there is no more after this one....",

    "description": "Very rarely are sizeable, oceanfront \"promontory\" parcels offered for sale in Laguna Beach.  Perhaps there are only six promontory parcels in town...and, few are as large as this double-plus parcel.  Particularly worth noting too, this landmark contemporary home has gated steps to its privately owned sandy beach and its secured cabana with a kitchenette and bathroom.   Although the home was built by its original owners in the 1959-65 timeframe, the current owners, who are only the second owners, have beautifully updated and maintained this home since purchasing it approximately 35 years ago.  The uniqueness continues...most likely, this is the only Laguna Beach home with a sturdily constructed steel and concrete \"safe room.\"  Living on this extra large promontory parcel, you will love the mesmerizing surf and the spectacular panoramic whitewater ocean views...spanning from the Palos Verdes Peninsula to San Diego's Coronado Island.  Yes, without a doubt, this is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity........The home is fully furnished and also available for a 31-day rental at $42,500.",

This exceptional residence, in this idyllic collection of homes is perched on a nearly 9,000 square-foot parcel. Balanced architectural elements and rich interiors evoke a refined, yet relaxed experience at every turn. The primary rooms presenting elegant and comfortable living, dining, and entertaining; as well as the gym, four bedrooms and four baths are replete with superb finish and detail. An impressive selection of appointments and materials were employed – an abundance of French White Oak, Travertine, and imported stones; two levels of walls of glass and bi-folding glass doors; rich metal and wood cladding; custom millwork; artisan-crafted lighting; spa-like bath features; the finest appliances including Miele, Thermador, Bosch, and SubZero; and Lutron Radio Ra2 home technology. The exterior surround and lush grounds envelop the property with mature foliage, fruit trees, and specimen plants. Each of the two arced terraces create a harmonious connection with the serene natural setting and sublime views of the Pacific. The ground-level terrace leads to a meandering tiered garden, while the second level is fashioned with a sun-drenched veranda, fully equipped outdoor kitchen, and a luminous crescent pool ‘floating’ above spectacular coastline vistas. A complement to any lifestyle, this remarkable offering affords an opportunity beyond compare.",

    "description": "Often, the most special of homes are those architects design as their own. Originally built by architect Terry Mechling (associate of renowned residential architect Fred Briggs), this modern masterpiece retains much of its original power and nuance thanks to the careful stewardship of the current architect owner. Most noticeable are the dynamic lines, meticulous and thoughtful placement of large windows framing the vast canyon views, and the quality of the light drawn in throughout the home. The floorplan is functional and well planned – the entry level holds a living room with a massive view window and vaulted ceilings, an elevated oak-floored area for dining or conservatory, a kitchen abundant with glowing woods and modern appliances, and a view deck with a unique flying beam that beautifully frames the sky above. A stunning wood and sculpted-steel curving staircase provides a glorious entry to the middle bedroom level. A wide gallery hall links the bedrooms and exits to an oversized covered terrace – perfect for an outdoor California room. Another graceful, custom-crafted staircase leads to the lowest level – an amazing large bonus space that could serve as office, media room, bedroom, or studio. Throughout the home, the windows bring the outdoors inside and the light is always at play across the day. Updates (such as the newer primary bath) are considered and careful, respectful of the design integrity of the original home. Located in picturesque and peaceful Bluebird Canyon, the home is just minutes from Laguna’s beaches and shops. Ample parking is on-site – a two car garage (complete with a canyon view picture window) enters the home adjacent to the kitchen, while the drive provides space for three to four more vehicles. Special homes are rare – 1369 Bluebird Canyon Drive is just that - a special, architectural gem.",

Finished with vaulted open-beam wood ceilings, wood flooring, smooth white walls, sleek stair railings, and an abundance of view-enriched windows, the home is welcoming to all. Generously sized at approximately 2,333 square feet, the floorplan features additional non-measured spaces, including a temperature-controlled wine cellar storing nearly 2,000 bottles and unfinished storage room with a separate entrance. The primary suite sits off the kitchen and offers sublime, in-bed views, a walk-in closet, and elegant bath beneath a skylight. Further along, a secondary en suite guest bedroom provides a hillside panorama. Idyllic for guests, the lower level features a third bedroom, guest bath with oversized walk-in shower, living room with fireplace, wet bar, sizable laundry room, additional views, and separate entrance. Indoor-outdoor entertaining is easily enjoyed on the main level, which opens to a covered wraparound view deck, and hosts a fireplace-warmed living room, dining space, and kitchen complemented by generous wood cabinetry, quartz countertops, a Viking cooktop and a built-in Liebherr refrigerator. A fabulous location complements the home, placing it close to Bluebird Park, Laguna’s famous beaches, award-winning schools, and village shops and restaurants.",

Over the course of 4 years of construction to the highest standards and many more years of development before that, visionaries transformed this unique setting into a world-class compound that can never be duplicated. Seemingly endless stunning oceanfront like views permeate this landmark. The View is a brand new constructed modern home set on an incomparable double-lot spanning over 11,000 sq ft of land with beach access, ocean views that cover the entire 185’ width of the estate, and no neighbors on either side of you, making it feel as though it is in a world unto itself. Transcendent composition spreads the home out across the vast piece of land resulting in exceptional oceanfront like views from every room in the house, and a home with a truly open concept and only 2 stories adding grandeur to the look and feel of the spaces. The very open feel extends into the master suite conveniently placed on the main level. Highly prized rear facing ocean views are the perfect accompaniment for outdoor seating spaces with spectacular ocean views off all areas and bedrooms of the home. Outdoor-living, a quintessential aspect of the California lifestyle, is the inspiration for the approximately 439 sq ft of decks and 570 sq ft of covered outdoor spaces that feature dramatic ocean views, and the state-of-the-art sliding doors that frame the spectacular views at every opening except for 1 bathroom. Sophisticated planning produced magnificent ocean views from all 4 sides of the property surrounding the home. Highly sought after yet scarcely found loggia perfect for year round usage boasts dazzling oceanfront like views, surround sound, 6’ cool-to-the-touch linear fireplace, 75” tv, 60” flush mounted heaters. Phenomenal ocean views begin from the drive to the home, & oceanfront like views welcome you home at the grand glass entry pivot door. The magnitude of the quantity and quality of these picturesque views is unrivaled by oceanfront homes in Laguna Beach. Every detail has been handcrafted using the finest finishes: European style cabinets, marble & limestone slabs, Wolf & Sub Zero appliances, Lutron & Control 4 automation, 3 surround sound locations & many zones, 3 cool-to-the-touch linear fireplaces including 8’ one in great room with 85” tv above it, high ceilings, security system, floating tub, 4 climate zones.",

Located in the Historic Art Colony district with streets aptly named after many of Laguna's most famous early artists, this home offers ocean and Catalina Island views from a perch that feels as if you are in a treehouse. The layout offers three lower-level bedrooms, two baths, one on each floor, and an open floor plan. The upper level has vaulted ceilings and vibrant natural light. The refurbished kitchen, with stunning fossilized stone counters, opens to the living and dining spaces making the home feel larger than it is. The living room has a brick fireplace that extends to a cozy, windowed nook looking out onto the surrounding foliage and ocean view beyond. Outside, the passion of this property continues with adorable grounds, a large deck and several areas for outdoor dining and entertaining that can only be fully appreciated in person. Meticulously manicured, the surrounding grounds are as fabulous as the inside. Ideally located in the heart of the City, far enough to avoid the hubbub of tourist parking, but close enough to stroll into town, this home is a unique treasure. Considering all that Laguna Beach has to offer: picturesque beaches (of course), over 20,000 acres of open space, incredible art, amazing schools, world-class dining and so much more, this is a must-see property.",

    "description": "Surrounded by privacy hedges, little of this special North Laguna property is evident from the street. Once behind the gates, the elevated sense of style emerges – from the front courtyard to the dual residences and abundant outdoor space, this is a nuanced, comfortable retreat. The front residence showcases the sophisticated design. With two bedrooms and two baths, this is a home to enjoy privately or with friends. The sleek kitchen serves as the centerpiece, but the living spaces on each end of the home provide the bling. With a sweep of mid-century windows to the front and an open wall of glass to the rear, the outdoors play as large a part of the design as the inner spaces. An amazing tiered courtyard between the two homes provides an entertaining focal point that can host intimate gatherings or large soirees. The property is built to truly live indoor/outdoor. Behind the courtyard sits a second two bedroom home, providing a myriad of living options. 170 High Drive is unlike any home available in Laguna Beach. Clever design, updated by the current owners, delights at every turn. The flexible two home layout is a study in California Cool. All this, while just a short jaunt from the beaches, art galleries, restaurants and desirable lifestyle that make Laguna Beach so enviable.",

    "description": "Rising impressively above Summit Drive, the residence at 794 Summit is a surprisingly spacious and sophisticated home. Once inside, the sense of neighbors and the street below melts away and the gorgeous ocean views command your attention. The main level, accessible by elevator from the street level, is a study in gracious open living with pocketing doors allowing seamless indoor/outdoor living and access to a generously sized ocean view terrace. The upper level of the home hosts a sumptuous primary suite with an abundant private view deck, and a large fully finished home office with dual desks. Straddling a street-to-street parcel, the property comes with a rare commodity for view living in Laguna Beach – abundant parking with a two car garage and room for two additional vehicles below, and off-street private parking for up to four more vehicles above. The finish level and bespoke detail work is superb, creating a special environment that feels like no other home. The main-level kitchen, with media and breakfast rooms adjacent, plays exotic woods against high-end hard surfaces to create a stunning and functional heart of the home. Secondary bedrooms are on the entry level, nicely separated from the primary suite. The soaring staircase creates a wonderful focal point in the center of the residence – capped by a custom round skylight that fills the center of the home with sunshine. During the day, the home is awash in light. At night, the custom lighting adds nuance and drama to the home while the city lights come alive below. A custom stainless steel art fountain welcomes you to the home, and an additional unique water feature provides a focal point for one of the many outdoor spaces. This is not the ordinary – 794 Summit Drive is an extraordinary ocean view retreat that delights at every turn.",

    "description": "What a great location to have a Laguna Beach cottage! It is just a half mile flat walk to the Pageant of the Masters, one mile to jump in the ocean at Main Beach or stroll downtown visiting renowned art galleries and restaurants. The cottage is situated on a quiet, tree lined cul-de-sac. This home offers a unique balance of walkability and privacy not often found in Laguna Beach. There is lots of potential for expansion on the highly desirable 10,000 sq ft flat lot. In 2014 the city reviewed architectural drawings expanding the home to 1800+ sq ft with an addition of a garage. The review panel voted to continue the favorable design. The home also has a separate metal and wood workshop which is about 400 sq ft.  The private backyard is an artists's retreat escape.  Don\"t miss this great opportunity to own a piece of Laguna charm.",

    "description": "Panoramic Ocean View! Work from home and enjoy for ocean breeze! 900 Rembrandt Drive is one of a kind. Encased in dramatic floor-to-ceiling glass windows, you walk in the front door and are immediately wow'd by the ocean views to the south of Catalina and to north of Long Beach. The picturesque Laguna coastline is enjoyed in nearly every room and is the epitome and elegance of beach living. The main level enjoys expansive soaring A-frame wood ceilings with an overall floorplan that will comfortably accommodate single-story living. The partially remodeled kitchen has upgraded top-of-the-line appliances with a slider to the deck for fun and easy grilling. Feeling creative you can convert one of the four bedrooms to an alternate use like the downstairs art studio flooded with natural light. In addition, this home offers a spacious office with coveted private access from French doors off the entry level deck.  With additional slider and window, this room welcomes the ocean breeze as you work. A gym with direct outside entrance is still another perk this house provides for enjoying all the luxuries right at home. The property has been newly land and hardscaped and is one of the many attractions of stepping outside. The attached two-car garage has direct access to the house and a driveway large enough for 2 additional cars. Close to the Village you have easy access to shopping and world-class dining, as well as laid-back local eateries for a weekend break. This beautiful home has been so loved that it has not been on the market for nearly 30 years. Come and enjoy the experience as the warmth and love of this home welcomes you!",

    "description": "2-family in quiet neighborhood about 100 yds from lake, yet, walking distance to most anything in Worcester.  Lake view.  Both apartments are in great shape with lots of higher-end upgrades and very nice for rentals.  Move in ready.  All mechanicals, electrical, plumbing, driveway and common areas have either been upgraded/replaced since initial purchase.  Common areas are finished as interiors- not common.  Has a bonus common sunroom and large storage in back that was a fully conditioned attached two car garage if you want to convert it back, it would be simple.  Yard is is easily among nicest in whole neighborhood, flat and private, with a massive amount of plantings that bring waves of color during gardening season.  House is perfect for someone who is looking to start a family in great neighborhood and needs a yard for entertaining or children to play in with total comfort.  Owner bought house for mother over 25yrs ago to make sure she had her rent controlled and she is no longer there.

    "description": "This one bedroom condo is a little slice of paradise. It's located in the gated community of The Shipyard in Truman Annex, so you're close to all the action but far enough away that you can escape it when needed. Plus, it's an end unit with extra windows for natural light, and it has been recently renovated with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen and an updated bathroom. You'll love relaxing on the large, private rear deck after a long day - or better yet, watching Fantasy Fest from your front row seat on Southard Street! The condo is offered furnished, so you can just move right in. Located just steps from the community pool, Duval Street, and the Truman waterfront. This unit has a special Truman Annex Transient license and a private parking space.",
