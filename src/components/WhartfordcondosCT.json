Two bedrooms both good sized, with hardwood floors and plenty of natural light.  A bathroom with gorgeous vanity, wood covered radiator (super cool) and tiled walls.

    "description": "OPEN HOUSE SUNDAY MARCH 24TH 1:00-3:00. Enter this bright and spacious 55+ active adult community home and you see immediately why the Edinburgh model is the most sought after unit that rarely comes up for sale. Constructed late during Henley Way's development, it maintains the open spaces as it eliminates the unnecessary 3rd bedroom of previous models. The additional square footage adds ample space to other critical living areas highlighted by a large eat-in kitchen with much more cabinetry and plenty of glass to let all the sunlight in. A separate, and well proportioned, dining and living room area gives plenty of space to entertain and leads to a sunroom that brings the outdoors in with 3 large slider units covering most of the outside walls. A large master suite includes full bath and walk-in closet. 2nd floor is a private location for guests or an office featuring a large bedroom, also with full bath and walk-in closet. Laundry area is tucked away near the master bedroom for convenience. Kitchen, sunroom, and all bathrooms have ceramic tile flooring. 2 pets (dogs or cats) of gentle disposition are allowed. Experience this newer construction condominium and see how the layout is the best in the complex.  Call Rick McCullough for a private showing at (413)531-5557.",

The kitchen has been updated with granite countertops, stainless appliances, and beautiful cabinetry. Ample closets throughout as well as a large pantry. Laundry is in the unit.  Low HOA fees and covered parking. Unit 5 would be a great investment and a great place to call home!",
