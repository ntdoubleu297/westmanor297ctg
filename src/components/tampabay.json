    "description": "DO NOT MISS THE GREAT MINI-MOVIE UNDER THE VIRTUAL TOUR.  IT'S MUST SEE T.V.!  Turnkey, mint condition.  Great jazz is floating through the air, someone's cranking up the cocktail shaker, and EVERYONE'S having a great time.  This is the little house that ROARED. EZ flow from Liv. Rm. to Din. Rm. to intimate den, all paved in beautiful, new hardwood floors.  Speaking of new:  Here's the list: Brand new magazine-worthy kitchen w/ all new appliances, brand new roof, new a/c, updated plumbing, high impact windows, new hot water heater, brand new paint inside and out, new, upgraded insulation, updated plumbing.  There's a genuine intimacy here that easily converts to ballgame parties, dinner parties, kids' birthday celebrations, or just dinner for two.  The large screened lanai enjoys views of the generous yard high-lighted by a big shady oak, planted the year the present owners first moved in. And, for extra storage and projects, the large (13 x 10) shed is wired with electricity. The half bath/utility room is not reflected in the county records, so add an extra 48 sq.ft.  A friendly, no-thru circle, this is one of the prettiest streets in Margaret Anne Subdivision.... with ez access to Westshore on one end and Manhattan on the other, close to  an electorama of activities:  Walk to Dairy Joy, the vegetable market, shabby chic shops, or hop the Gandy to the beaches.  Welcome Home!",

Could be flipped and brought to a higher retail value (250-450k depending on finishes) with upgrades and cosmetic work. Original terrazzo flooring, newer Trane AC unit and handler, newer hot water heater and windows, needs a new roof, spacious backyard with concrete patio. There is also a separate utility/storage room off the garage. GREAT investment opportunity.",

The kitchen features granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, and a raised bar stool height breakfast counter. Just off of the living area is a large hallway connecting the bathroom and both bedrooms. On the opposite end of the home is a sunken space that can be used as a dining room, or the living area depending on how you work it! The sliding barn doors add function and decoration by concealing the stacked washer and dryer and also a small utility room that leads to the backyard. The backyard has it all and offers a large over-hang to hide from the sun, concrete parking pad, and lush green grass! It's the perfect space for entertaining on beautiful Florida days. AC and Roof are both less than 6 years old.",
